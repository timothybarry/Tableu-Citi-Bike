How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

There was a total of 16,364,657 rides in 2017

By what percentage has total ridership grown? 

Between March and October 2017 we saw an increase of 160%, followed by a steep decline in ridership in the winter months.  

How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

It seems that the proportion of short-term vs long term customers remains relatively consistant with the largest impact on ridership being the time of year (weather).  

What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 
What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

Displayed in sheets 3 and 4: Trend follows typical business hour commutes. 

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

Displayed in sheets 5 and 6.  These stations are probably in highly populated areas, near public transportation, schools and businesses.  

Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

75% male and 25% female. This is one of the phenomena that will be discussed in the final section.  

How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

Judging by the previous statistic, gender outreach has not been very effective.  

How does the average trip duration change by age?

There is a relatively normal distribution of ages centered around 28 years old with some statistical outliers with long ride durations and a birth date in the 1800â€™s which probably means there is an input error somewhere or there is a disturbing trend of 100+ year old lizard people roaming manhattan riding citi bikes for thousands of hours at a time.  

What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

994.6 Miles

Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? 
Sheet 12
How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:


A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

If you're working with a merged dataset: a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.


Lastly, as a chronic overachiever:


Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence.

Gender distribution and average duration of trip by age showed some suprising results that are shown in the final dashboard.
